## 🎯 Introduction

### What is This Project?

This notebook provides a **comprehensive, side-by-side comparison** of 6 different deep learning architectures, all trained on the same dataset with the same methodology. Rather than just showing "how to train a model," this project answers the crucial question:

> **"Which architecture should I choose for my problem, and why?"**

### Why This Matters

In modern deep learning, there's no single "best" architecture. Each design makes different trade-offs between:
- 📊 **Accuracy**: How well does it perform?
- ⚡ **Speed**: How fast can it train and inference?
- 💾 **Size**: How many parameters does it need?
- 🔋 **Efficiency**: How many FLOPs (floating-point operations)?
- 🎯 **Complexity**: How hard is it to implement and understand?

This notebook helps you understand these trade-offs **empirically** with real data.

### Architectures Compared

1. **Basic CNN** - The foundation of computer vision
2. **ResNet** - Residual learning enables very deep networks
3. **DenseNet** - Dense connectivity for feature reuse
4. **EfficientNet** - Compound scaling for optimal efficiency
5. **CNN + SE (Attention)** - Channel-wise attention mechanisms
6. **Vision Transformer (ViT)** - Self-attention for image patches

## 📚 Detailed Architecture Explanations

### 1. Basic CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

#### 🎓 Theory

The **Convolutional Neural Network** is the foundation of computer vision. Introduced by Yann LeCun with LeNet-5 (1998), CNNs revolutionized image processing by learning hierarchical features automatically.

**Core Concepts:**

1. **Convolutional Layers**: Apply learnable filters to detect patterns
   - Early layers: edges, corners, simple shapes
   - Deep layers: complex features, object parts
   
2. **Pooling Layers**: Reduce spatial dimensions while retaining important information
   - MaxPooling: Takes maximum value in a region
   - Provides translation invariance
   
3. **Fully Connected Layers**: Combine features for final classification

#### 🔧 Architecture Design

```python
Input (48×48×1)
    ↓
Conv2D(32 filters, 3×3) + ReLU
    ↓
MaxPooling2D(2×2)
    ↓
Conv2D(64 filters, 3×3) + ReLU
    ↓
MaxPooling2D(2×2)
    ↓
Conv2D(128 filters, 3×3) + ReLU
    ↓
Flatten
    ↓
Dense(128) + ReLU
    ↓
Dense(7) + Softmax
```

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Simple & Interpretable**: Easy to understand and implement
- **Good Baseline**: Establishes performance floor
- **Limited Depth**: Can't go too deep without degradation
- **Spatial Hierarchy**: Features become more abstract in deeper layers

#### 💡 When to Use
- ✅ Starting point for any vision task
- ✅ When you need simple, interpretable models
- ✅ Limited computational resources
- ✅ Small to medium datasets

#### ⚠️ Limitations
- ❌ Struggles with very deep architectures (vanishing gradients)
- ❌ Less parameter efficient than modern architectures
- ❌ No skip connections = harder to train when deep

---

### 2. ResNet (Residual Network)

#### 🎓 Theory

**ResNet** (He et al., 2015) solved a fundamental problem: **degradation in deep networks**. Surprisingly, adding more layers to a network made it perform *worse*, not better. This wasn't overfitting—even training accuracy degraded!

**Key Innovation: Skip Connections (Residual Connections)**

Instead of learning \( H(x) \) directly, learn the **residual** \( F(x) = H(x) - x \)

```
       Input x
         ┃
    ┏━━━━╋━━━━┓
    ┃    ┃    ┃
  Conv  ┃    ┃  (skip connection)
    ┃    ┃    ┃
  Conv  ┃    ┃
    ┃    ┃    ┃
    ┗━━━━╋━━━━┛
         + (add)
         ┃
      Output
```

**Why This Works:**
1. **Gradient Flow**: Gradients can flow directly through skip connections
2. **Identity Mapping**: Easy to learn identity function (do nothing)
3. **Ensemble Effect**: Network becomes ensemble of shallow networks
4. **Better Optimization**: Easier optimization landscape

#### 🔧 Implementation Details

**Residual Block Structure:**
```python
def residual_block(x, filters, stride=1):
    # Main path
    fx = Conv2D(filters, 3×3, stride)(x)
    fx = BatchNorm()(fx)
    fx = ReLU()(fx)
    fx = Conv2D(filters, 3×3)(fx)
    fx = BatchNorm()(fx)
    
    # Shortcut path
    if stride != 1 or channels_changed:
        x = Conv2D(filters, 1×1, stride)(x)  # Match dimensions
        x = BatchNorm()(x)
    
    # Add and activate
    output = ReLU()(fx + x)
    return output
```

**Our Implementation:**
- Initial Conv2D(32) layer
- Residual block with 32 filters
- Residual block with 64 filters (stride=2)
- Residual block with 128 filters (stride=2)
- GlobalAveragePooling2D
- Dense(7) for classification

#### 💡 Key Insights

1. **Depth is Powerful**: Can train networks with 50, 101, even 1000+ layers
2. **Batch Normalization**: Critical for training deep ResNets
3. **Dimension Matching**: Skip connections need same dimensions (use 1×1 conv)
4. **Training Stability**: Much more stable than plain deep CNNs

#### 🎯 When to Use
- ✅ When you need deep networks (>20 layers)
- ✅ Complex vision tasks requiring hierarchical features
- ✅ Transfer learning (pretrained ResNets available)
- ✅ When training stability is important

#### 📊 Trade-offs
- **Pros**: Very deep, stable training, excellent performance
- **Cons**: More parameters than basic CNN, slightly slower

---

### 3. DenseNet (Densely Connected Network)

#### 🎓 Theory

**DenseNet** (Huang et al., 2017) took skip connections to the extreme: **connect every layer to every other layer** in a feed-forward fashion.

**Key Innovation: Dense Connectivity**

In a dense block, each layer receives feature maps from **all preceding layers**:

```
Layer 1 ━━━━━┓
    ┃        ┃
Layer 2 ━━━━╋━━━┓
    ┃       ┃   ┃
Layer 3 ━━━━╋━━━╋━━━┓
    ┃       ┃   ┃   ┃
    ┗━━━━━━━╋━━━╋━━━┫
            ┃   ┃   ┃
        Layer 4 (concatenates all)
```

**Formula**: Layer \( l \) receives: \( [x_0, x_1, ..., x_{l-1}] \) (concatenated)

#### 🔬 Why Dense Connections?

1. **Feature Reuse**: Earlier features directly accessible to all layers
2. **Gradient Flow**: Implicit deep supervision, gradients reach all layers
3. **Parameter Efficiency**: Each layer adds only a few features (growth rate)
4. **Regularization Effect**: Acts as a deep regularizer

#### 🔧 Architecture Components

**Dense Block:**
```python
# Each layer sees all previous features
x0 = input
x1 = Conv(BN(ReLU(x0)))
x2 = Conv(BN(ReLU(concat[x0, x1])))
x3 = Conv(BN(ReLU(concat[x0, x1, x2])))
# etc.
```

**Transition Layer** (between dense blocks):
- BatchNorm → Conv1×1 → AvgPool2×2
- Reduces spatial dimensions
- Compresses features (θ = 0.5 typically)

**Our Implementation:**
- Uses **DenseNet121** from Keras Applications
- 121 layers total: 4 dense blocks
- Growth rate k=32 (adds 32 features per layer)
- Compression factor θ=0.5
- Adapted for 48×48 grayscale input

#### 💡 Key Insights

1. **Compact Representation**: Fewer parameters than ResNet for similar performance
2. **Memory Intensive**: Concatenation requires more memory during training
3. **Feature Reuse**: Lower layers' features available to all subsequent layers
4. **Regularization**: Dense connections prevent overfitting

#### 🎯 When to Use
- ✅ Limited parameters budget
- ✅ Need strong regularization
- ✅ Transfer learning tasks
- ✅ When feature reuse is beneficial

#### ⚠️ Considerations
- ❌ High memory consumption during training
- ❌ Slower than ResNet (more operations per layer)
- ❌ Complex to implement from scratch

---

### 4. EfficientNet (Compound Scaling)

#### 🎓 Theory

**EfficientNet** (Tan & Le, 2019) asked a fundamental question: *How should we scale up CNNs?*

Traditional approaches scaled **one dimension**:
- Scale depth (more layers) → ResNet-50, ResNet-101
- Scale width (more channels) → WideResNet
- Scale resolution (larger images) → Higher input size

**Key Innovation: Compound Scaling**

Scale **all three dimensions** simultaneously with a compound coefficient φ:
- **Depth**: \( d = α^φ \)
- **Width**: \( w = β^φ \)
- **Resolution**: \( r = γ^φ \)

Where \( α × β² × γ² ≈ 2 \) (constraint)

#### 🔬 Why Compound Scaling?

**Intuition**: These dimensions are interdependent
- Larger images → need more layers (depth) to increase receptive field
- More layers → need wider network (width) to capture finer features
- Wider network → can process higher resolution more effectively

**EfficientNet-B0**: Baseline found via Neural Architecture Search (NAS)
- **EfficientNet-B1 to B7**: Scale up using compound coefficient

#### 🔧 Architecture Components

**Mobile Inverted Bottleneck (MBConv)**:
```python
Input (narrow)
    ↓
Expand (Conv1×1) → wider
    ↓
DepthwiseConv3×3 → efficient spatial processing
    ↓
SE Block → channel attention
    ↓
Project (Conv1×1) → narrow again
    ↓
+ (skip if same size)
```

**Key Features:**
1. **Inverted Residuals**: Expand → Process → Compress
2. **Depthwise Separable Convolutions**: Faster, fewer parameters
3. **Squeeze-Excitation**: Built-in attention
4. **Swish Activation**: \( x × σ(x) \) instead of ReLU

**Our Implementation:**
- **EfficientNet-B0**: Smallest variant
- Adapted for 48×48 grayscale input
- GlobalAveragePooling + Dense(7)
- No pretrained weights (training from scratch)

#### 💡 Key Insights

1. **Balanced Scaling**: Better than scaling one dimension
2. **Efficiency**: Best accuracy/FLOPs trade-off at publication time
3. **Mobile-Friendly**: Designed for resource-constrained devices
4. **Modern Design**: Incorporates best practices (SE, Swish, etc.)

#### 🎯 When to Use
- ✅ Need best accuracy/efficiency trade-off
- ✅ Mobile or edge deployment
- ✅ Limited computational budget
- ✅ Transfer learning from ImageNet

#### 📊 Performance Characteristics
- **Pros**: Highly efficient, excellent accuracy, scalable
- **Cons**: Complex architecture, harder to customize, requires careful scaling

---

### 5. CNN + SE (Squeeze-and-Excitation Attention)

#### 🎓 Theory

**Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks** (Hu et al., 2018) introduced **channel-wise attention** to CNNs. The key insight: not all channels (feature maps) are equally important for a given input.

**Problem**: Standard convolutions treat all channels equally

**Solution**: Learn to weight channels based on their importance

#### 🔬 How SE Blocks Work

**Three Steps: Squeeze → Excitation → Scale**

```python
Input: X (H×W×C)
    ↓
1. SQUEEZE: Global Average Pooling
    → (1×1×C)  # Compress spatial dimensions
    ↓
2. EXCITATION: Two FC layers
    Dense(C/r, ReLU)  # r=reduction ratio (typically 8 or 16)
    Dense(C, Sigmoid)
    → (1×1×C)  # Channel attention weights
    ↓
3. SCALE: Multiply
    X * weights (broadcast)
    → (H×W×C)  # Reweighted features
```

**Mathematical Formulation:**
\[
\text{SE}(X) = X \odot \sigma(W_2 \cdot \text{ReLU}(W_1 \cdot \text{GAP}(X)))
\]

Where:
- GAP = Global Average Pooling
- \( W_1 \): Dimensionality reduction (C → C/r)
- \( W_2 \): Dimensionality restoration (C/r → C)
- σ = Sigmoid (produces 0-1 weights)
- ⊙ = Element-wise multiplication (channel-wise)

#### 🔧 Implementation

**SE Block:**
```python
def se_block(x, ratio=8):
    channels = x.shape[-1]
    
    # Squeeze: Global information
    se = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)  # (H,W,C) → (C)
    
    # Excitation: Channel importance
    se = Dense(channels // ratio, activation='relu')(se)  # Bottleneck
    se = Dense(channels, activation='sigmoid')(se)  # Attention weights
    
    # Reshape for broadcasting
    se = Reshape((1, 1, channels))(se)
    
    # Scale: Reweight channels
    return Multiply()([x, se])
```

**Our CNN+SE Architecture:**
- Conv2D(32) → SE Block → MaxPool
- Conv2D(64) → SE Block → GlobalAvgPool
- Dense(7) for classification

#### 💡 Key Insights

1. **Lightweight**: Adds only ~1% parameters but can improve accuracy 1-2%
2. **Plug-and-Play**: Can be added to any CNN architecture
3. **Adaptive**: Attention weights change per input
4. **Interpretable**: Can visualize which channels are important

#### 🎯 Visual Intuition

Imagine looking at a dog image:
- **Texture channels** (fur): High attention weights
- **Shape channels** (dog outline): High attention weights
- **Irrelevant background**: Low attention weights

The network learns this automatically!

#### 🎯 When to Use
- ✅ Existing CNN not performing well enough
- ✅ Want cheap performance boost
- ✅ Need interpretability (channel importance)
- ✅ Small overhead acceptable

#### 📊 Trade-offs
- **Pros**: Tiny overhead, significant gains, widely applicable
- **Cons**: Small improvement (not revolutionary), adds complexity

#### 🔬 Variants & Extensions
- **CBAM**: Adds spatial attention (where to look)
- **BAM**: Bottleneck attention module
- **ECA**: Efficient Channel Attention (no dimensionality reduction)

### 6. Vision Transformer (ViT)

#### 🎓 Theory

**Vision Transformer** (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) challenged a 30-year assumption: *Do we even need convolutions for vision?*

**Spoiler**: No! Pure attention can work remarkably well.

**Key Innovation**: Apply Transformer architecture (from NLP) directly to images

#### 🔬 How ViT Works

**Step 1: Patch Embedding**
```
Image (48×48)
    ↓
Split into patches (6×6 patches = 8×8 patches total)
    ↓
Each patch → Linear projection → Embedding (64-dim)
    ↓
Add positional embeddings (which patch is where?)
    → Sequence of 64 embeddings
```

**Step 2: Transformer Encoder**
```
Patch embeddings
    ↓
┌─────────────────┐
│ Multi-Head      │  ← Self-attention: patches interact
│ Attention       │
└─────────────────┘
    ↓ + (residual)
    ↓
┌─────────────────┐
│ LayerNorm       │
└─────────────────┘
    ↓
┌─────────────────┐
│ MLP             │  ← 2-layer feedforward
│ (Dense-ReLU)    │
└─────────────────┘
    ↓ + (residual)
    ↓
Repeat N times (we use 2 layers)
```

**Step 3: Classification**
```
Final embeddings
    ↓
Global Average Pooling
    ↓
Dense(7, softmax)
```

#### 🧩 Self-Attention Mechanism

**What is Self-Attention?**

Each patch can "attend to" (look at) every other patch:

```
Q (Query): What am I looking for?
K (Key): What do I contain?
V (Value): What do I output?

Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T / √d) V
```

**Multi-Head Attention**: Run attention multiple times in parallel (4 heads in our case)
- Head 1 might focus on textures
- Head 2 might focus on shapes
- Head 3 might focus on spatial relationships
- Head 4 might focus on colors

#### 🔧 Our Implementation Details

```python
def build_vit(input_shape=(48,48,1), num_classes=7,
              patch_size=6,      # Each patch is 6×6
              num_heads=4,       # 4 attention heads
              proj_dim=64,       # Embedding dimension
              layers_num=2):     # 2 Transformer blocks
```

**Architecture:**
1. Convert grayscale to 3-channel (compatibility)
2. Patch embedding via Conv2D(64, 6×6, stride=6)
3. Flatten to sequence: (8×8, 64)
4. Add positional embeddings
5. 2× Transformer blocks (attention + MLP)
6. Global average pooling
7. Classification head

#### 💡 Key Insights

1. **No Inductive Bias**: Unlike CNNs (locality, translation invariance), ViT learns everything from data
2. **Data Hungry**: Needs large datasets to work well (or pretrain on ImageNet)
3. **Global Receptive Field**: Every patch sees every other patch from layer 1
4. **Positional Embeddings**: Must explicitly tell the model spatial relationships

#### 🎯 When to Use
- ✅ Large datasets available (>100K images)
- ✅ Transfer learning from pretrained ViT
- ✅ Need global context (CNNs have limited receptive field)
- ✅ Experimenting with latest techniques

#### ⚠️ Limitations on Small Datasets
On FER2013 (28K images), ViT may underperform CNNs because:
- ❌ Lacks CNN's inductive biases
- ❌ Needs more data to learn spatial relationships
- ❌ Our simple implementation vs. highly optimized CNNs

#### 🚀 Why ViT is Revolutionary

1. **Unified Architecture**: Same model for vision and NLP
2. **Scalability**: Scales better with data than CNNs
3. **Interpretability**: Attention maps show what model focuses on
4. **Foundation Models**: Enables large-scale pretraining (CLIP, DINO)

#### 📊 Trade-offs
- **Pros**: Cutting-edge, scalable, theoretically interesting
- **Cons**: Data hungry, complex, may not beat CNNs on small datasets
