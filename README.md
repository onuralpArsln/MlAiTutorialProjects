### MathValClass

This folder contains projects focused on classifying numerical data using machine learning techniques. It serves as an introductory guide to classification applications.

 ### ImageClass

 This folder contains projects for image classification projects. Image classification can be considered as a simple application compared to many other things you can do with AI but beware that you need to create a good data set for good results. 

## Getting Started

To get started with the tutorials:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
