# Numerical Value Classification

This folder consists of projects that trains models to classify data using numerical values.

Since data is already in numerical from machine learning methods that based on statistical models are used.

Here is the list of methods that will be investigated

- Logistic Regression (LR)
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
- Classification and Regression Trees (CART).
- Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB).
- Support Vector Machines (SVM).


# Logistic Regression

Is a linear model suitable for binary classification. Uses logistic function.
Logistic function which is a type of sigmoid function (s shaped function basically).

It is suitable to create two groups which makes it suitable for binary classification.
